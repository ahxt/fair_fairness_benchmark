# Fair Fairness Benchmark

## Overview 
The Fair Fairness Benchmark is a PyTorch-based framework for evaluating the fairness of machine learning models. The framework is designed to be simple and customizable, making it accessible to researchers with varying levels of expertise. The benchmark includes a set of predefined fairness metrics and algorithms, but users can easily modify or add new metrics and algorithms to suit their specific research questions.

## Our Goals
This bechmark aims to create a Fair Fairness Benchmark, which are

* minimalistic
* hackable
* beginner-friendly
* torch-idiomatic
* reference implementation for researchers
* ......


## Installation
To install the Fair Fairness Benchmark, simply clone this repository and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the research community to improve and extend the Fair Fairness Benchmark. If you have an idea for a new metric or algorithm, or would like to report a bug, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
